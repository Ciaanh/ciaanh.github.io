As I writing this article I have been working on this addon for almost two years. 
This might seems a lot of time and I will present here my journey into learning to make an addon for World of Warcraft.

## Every journey start

To present a bit of context I am a C# developper but I am also a long time Blizzard fan. I first began with Warcraft II and its expansion Beyond the Dark Portal in 1996, due to some issues (the game was not in the box) before playing the game I read the manual, discovered the lore of this universe and fate was sealed.
Then came Warcraft III and in 2004 World of Warcraft. And I have been playing WoW for 15 years now, exploring Azeroth, trying some roleplay and... well reading the quests.

I've been really enjoying every minute of it but I found myself asking things like "When does the War of the three hammers happenned exactly?" or "If my character was born 23 years ago did he witnessed the fall of Stormwind?".
It felt really frustrating and one day came the WoW Chronicles book series and there came my idea to have a way to view the timeline of events that happenned as a timeline inside the game.

## Diving into addons

As I am a developer I knew I have some kind of skills that I could use for this project but 

ace
trys and errors

quit the dev
come back

start over from the ground
making the interface
making the db
making the modules
publish it
